# random-messages

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g leningael-random-messages
```

# Usage

```bash
random-msg
```

# Contributing
If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [random-msg](https://github.com/leningael/npm-package-example)
